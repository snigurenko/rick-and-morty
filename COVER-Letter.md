# Hi, here I want to note some information about the project. 

1. Use Vue CLI to make a  project
2. Use PUG and SCSS for own comfortable coding
3. Use vuex-persistedstate plugin for comfortable work with localStorage
4. As additional use: axios, luxon, createLogger.

# Future planing updates

1. Create unit test
2. Add TS
3. Add extra components to make project DRY 
4. Use BEM

##

As a main purpose was easy make a project, 
thats why I used some labories and plugins

*
Use Base.vue layout and put components to module folder to show good practice in creating biggest projects and to use DRY

*
about settings file, it is not using in this project, but here as a example to commercial projects
usually I put all variables, as a name and path, to one place to easy manage the project

*
useDebounced.js as a option, there is no need to put it here, but maybe u give me an extra point ;p

### Picel perfect 

1. I make from Figma pdf and then transform to PNG to attach to Perfect Pixel plugin at Chrome

* sometimes there was some different values like a distance between elements, I mean that firstly put all values correctly from figma, and than need to update them using Perfect Pixel

this PNG from figma I add to the root folder


P.S. sorry for not perfect ending the project, because firstly I planed finish unit tests and check more carefully with Pixel Perfect, 
but need to finish today, because have to leave for a couple days. 

Anyway, I back here to finish all that I mentioned when it will be possible because of current work duties
