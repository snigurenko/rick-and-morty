# rick-and-morty

1. Use Vue CLI to make a  project
2. Use PUG and SCSS for own comfortable coding
3. Use vuex-persistedstate plugin for comfortable work with localStorage
4. As additional use: axios, luxon, createLogger.

##

As a main purpose was easy make a project, 
thats why I used some labories and plugins

*
Use Base.vue layout and put components to module folder to show good practice in creating biggest projects and to use DRY

*
about settings file, it is not using in this project, but here as a example to commercial projects
usually I put all variables, as a name and path, to one place to easy manage the project

*
useDebounced.js as a option, there is no need to put it here, but maybe u give me an extra point ;p
